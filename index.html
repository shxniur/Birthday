            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>1. I really like when you hold my arms in public</h3>
                <p>It makes me feel so loved and protected when you hold my arms in public. It's a simple gesture, but it means the world to me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>2. I really like when you spam me snaps</h3>
                <p>Your constant stream of snaps throughout the day always puts a smile on my face. It's a little way for you to stay connected with me, and I cherish it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>3. I really like when you open up to me and tell me what's bothering you</h3>
                <p>I know it's not always easy for you to be vulnerable, but when you do, it makes me feel trusted and important. I'm here to listen and support you, no matter what.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>4. I really like when you prioritize me over others</h3>
                <p>I know you have a lot of demands on your time, but when you choose to prioritize me, it shows me how much I mean to you. It's a small thing that means so much.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>5. I really like when you assure me that how much you love me</h3>
                <p>Your constant reassurance of your love for me is a balm for my soul. It's a reminder that I am cherished and adored, and I could never ask for more.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Our Memorable Dates</h2>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>Our First Date</h3>
                <p>When I saw you for the first time, I was full of love. I was the happiest I could be, seeing my greatest achievement in front of me, and I could say I was blessed just by looking at those fairy eyes. And I will forever be thankful for taking that step with me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>Our First Kiss</h3>
                <p>At Mentu when we kissed, it was the moment I felt your lips for the first time, and it felt perfect. I felt like the luckiest man on earth to be able to kiss those lips, and whatever happens, I will always crave for that perfect kiss of yours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="memory-box">
                <h3>When I First Tasted Your Food</h3>
                <p>I can assure you that I will forever crave for foods you cooked, but when you first made pasta for me, it was hands down the best thing I ever tasted. I felt so lucky to be able to taste something so delicious.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Anniversary Surprise</h2>
            <button id="messageReveal">Reveal Your Special Message</button>
            <div id="specialMessage" class="hidden">
                <h3>To my dearest Momo,</h3>
                <p>As this is our first anniversary, my heart is overflowing with so many emotions. I might have called you my girlfriend before, but to me, you've always felt like my wife—my soulmate, my everything. You are the light that fills my days with joy, and no matter what happens, I will never be willing to leave you. My love for you is unshakable, and I want you to know that I am here to stay—forever.</p>

                <p>Over the past year, there have been times when I've overthought about things that happened in the past. I know it hasn't been easy, but I'm trying every day to work on myself, to let go of those thoughts, because you deserve the very best version of me. Your patience and understanding have made me want to be better, and for that, I'm forever grateful.</p>

                <p>Every moment we've spent together, every date we've been on, has been unforgettable. Whether it was a simple walk or a whirlwind, being with you made it perfect. I look back on each of those moments with so much love, knowing that each time, you gave me a piece of your heart. As they say in The Notebook, "It wasn't over, it still isn't over,"—because each memory with you, no matter how simple or grand, is something I will hold onto forever.</p>

                <p>You've put in so much effort and even changed yourself for me. You didn't have to, but you did it out of love, and I notice every little thing. From the way you listen to me to the ways you've adjusted for us to work—it's nothing short of incredible. I feel so lucky to have someone who cares enough to grow with me.</p>

                <p>Like in Pride and Prejudice when Mr. Darcy said, "You have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love, I love, I love you,"—that's exactly how I feel about you. You've captured every part of me, and there's no place I'd rather be than by your side, loving you, supporting you, and sharing this beautiful life together.</p>

                <p>Happy anniversary, my love. I wish to spend many more years of happiness, love, and endless memories. I love you more than words can ever express.</p>

                <p>Yours forever, Bhuban ❤️</p>
